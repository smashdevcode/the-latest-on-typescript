Things to research...

Project Support through tsconfig.json TypeScript
    Eliminates the need for "///reference" statements

Template Strings
    Defined with backticks "`"
    Allows for...
        Multiline Strings
        String Interpolation
        Tagged Templates
    A tagged template allows you to place a "tag" function before the template
        in order to pre process the results

Module Updates
    Internal modules are now just known as "namespaces"
    External modules are now just "modules"
    New module formats
        CommonJS
        AMD
        SystemJS
        UMD (universal format that works with both CommonJS and AMD)

ES6 Modules
    Supports both named and default exports
    Blog post about the spec
        http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html
    Universal module loader
        SystemJS - https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs
        Uses ES6 Module Loader - https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader
    Telerik blog post on ES6 modules

Destructuring
    The opposite of structuring data (i.e. structuring data using object literals)
    From MDN...
        "The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes
        it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that
        mirrors the construction of array and object literals."
    Two forms are supported...
        Object destructuring
        Array destructuring

Let
    Let's you define variables with block scope

Const
    Allows you to define constants

For..of Support
    Creates a loop iterating over iterable objects
        See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols
    Currently only works with arrays and strings

Decorators
    Part of ES7 so considered an experimental feature
    Currently being developed in collaboration with the Angular, Ember, and Aurelia teams
    To use decorators in your projects...
        You'll need to pass the --experimentalDecorators flag to the compiler
    Overview on TS decorators
        http://blog.wolksoftware.com/decorators-reflection-javascript-typescript
    Great Stack Overflow answer
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29775830/how-to-implement-a-typescript-decorator
    Information about property descriptors
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty
    Great article on how JS decorators could be used
        https://medium.com/@zackargyle/the-5-es7-decorators-i-want-to-use-now-ca40d1d5c114

Computed Properties
    Allows you to put an expression in brackets [], that will be computed as the property name

Spread
    Allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments
    (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected

Debugging in Chrome DevTools
    Set compiler options to generate source map files
    Select sources in Chrome developer tools
    Set a breakpoint in the TS code
    See http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2012-10-03-typescript-source-maps.html

Misc presentation nodes...

TS is a great combination of productivity boost and fun
    Makes JS more enjoyable to use

Do I really need to learn a new language?
    The learning curve is gentle
    Start with JS and add in data types
    Then start to use classes and namespaces
    Add in module loading when it makes sense

Your editor will give you more help
Your CI automated builds will check your code
Brings you closer to the future
Broad support from the community

TS will make you more productive
    Simple benefits like autocomplete
    Never worry again about not getting a member name correct
    The ability to reliably navigate through a project and find all references to members
