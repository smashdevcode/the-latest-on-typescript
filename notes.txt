Things to research...

Template Strings
    Defined with backticks "`"
    Allows for...
        Multiline Strings
        String Interpolation
        Tagged Templates
    A tagged template allows you to place a "tag" function before the template
        in order to pre process the results

Module Updates
    Internal modules are now just known as "namespaces"
    External modules are now just "modules"
    New module formats
        CommonJS
        AMD
        SystemJS
        UMD (universal format that works with both CommonJS and AMD)

ES6 Modules
    Supports both named and default exports
    Blog post about the spec
        http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html
    Universal module loader

Destructuring
    The opposite of structuring data (i.e. structuring data using object literals)
    From MDN...
        "The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes
        it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that
        mirrors the construction of array and object literals."
    Two forms are supported...
        Object destructuring
        Array destructuring

Let
    Let's you define variables with block scope

Const
    Allows you to define constants

For..of Support
    Creates a loop iterating over iterable objects
        See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols
    Currently only works with arrays and strings

Decorators
    Part of ES7 so considered an experimental feature
    Currently being developed in collaboration with the Angular, Ember, and Aurelia teams
    To use decorators in your projects...
        You'll need to pass the --experimentalDecorators flag to the compiler
    Overview on TS decorators
        http://blog.wolksoftware.com/decorators-reflection-javascript-typescript
    Great Stack Overflow answer
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29775830/how-to-implement-a-typescript-decorator
    Information about property descriptors
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty
    Great article on how JS decorators could be used

Computed Properties
    Allows you to put an expression in brackets [], that will be computed as the property name

Project Support through tsconfig.json TypeScript
    Eliminates the need for "///reference" statements

Spread
    Allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments
    (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected




Things described in the presentation announcement...

Union Types
Type Guards

Show how to debug outside of VS???
    Set compiler options to generate source map files
    Select sources in Chrome developer tools
    Set a breakpoint in the TS code
    See http://www.aaron-powell.com/posts/2012-10-03-typescript-source-maps.html
